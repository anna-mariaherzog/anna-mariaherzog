# About me

- I am currently working on the development of new inhibitors against key enzymes of human pathogens.
- The work is based on fragment-based drug discovery using X-ray crystallography followed by *in silico* optimization.
- I have gained experience in the use of *in silico* methods for fragment selection and optimization, but also the subsequent *in vitro* and *in vivo* testing of the efficacy of the molecules.
